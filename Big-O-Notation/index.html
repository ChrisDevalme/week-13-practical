    <h4>1) This function counts how many time a word appears in a phrase and has a Big O of O(n) or Linear growth.<h4/>

    <h4>2) This funtion is sorting the list of items and has a Big O of O(n^2).<h4/>
    
    <h4>3) This function is getting the factorial of the number presented and has a Big O of O(n).<h4/>
    
    <h4>4) This funtion is getting the first prerson at index 0 and has a Big O of O(1).<h4/>
    
    <h4>5) This function is checking whether or not the input is a palindrome and has a Big O of O(n).<h4/>
    
    <h4>6) This function is adding all the numbers that the input is dividible by, strating from 1 up until the input and has a Big O if O(n)<h4/>
    
    <h4>7) This function is first printing each value from num array, then printing each plus the previous value and has a Big O of O(n)<h4/>
        
    <h4>8) This function is checking whether or not the input is a prime number by dividing by using a loop to figure out if the input is divisible by its self. The Big O is O(n). <h4/>
